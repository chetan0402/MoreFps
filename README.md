# MoreFps
A performance Mod

# Suggested Java Args:-
-Xmx2G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -Xmn512M

Replace the 2 in -Xmx2G with half the size or your ram. For example:- If u have 8gb ram then put -Xmx4G instead of -Xmx2G

# DO NOT'S
Do not use this mod with a mod named FoamFix, these mods together somehow lower the fps by a great amount
